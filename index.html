<h1>VENKATESH VEMULA</h1>
<h6>Playing Cricket</h6>
<p> Cricket is a <b>bat-and-ball</b> game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end,
 each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. 
 The batting side <b> scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat </b> (and running between the wickets), 
 while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, 
 and getting the ball to either wicket) and <b>dismiss each batter </b> (so they are "out").</p>
