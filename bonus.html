<h2> Gray Eastern Screech-Owl</h2>

<p>The Gray Eastern Screech-Owl is a short, stocky bird, with a large head and almost no neck. Its wings are rounded; its tail is short and square. Pointed ear tufts are often raised, lending its head a distinctive silhouette.
 Gray Eastern Screech-Owls can be either mostly gray or mostly reddish-brown (rufous).
 Gray Eastern Screech-Owls are active at night and are far more often heard than seen—most bird watchers know this species only from its trilling or whinnying song.
 Trees define the Gray Eastern Screech-Owl’s habitat,particularly near water.
 The “McCall’s” Eastern Screech-Owl (Asio otus mccallii), inhabits south-central Texas and parts of northern Mexico. It may prove to be a separate species, as it is always gray and never gives the “whinny” call. The two common color morphs, gray and rufous, represent individual variation and don’t vary consistently by region or subspecies.
